# ProGrad Lab | Typescript Introduction - Strings and Numbers

## Learning Goals

After this lesson, you will be able to:

- Develop some basic TypeScript functions.
- Create a TypeScript interface, and use it from a class.
- Implement two different interfaces and use them from classes.

## Requirements

- Fork this repo.
- Clone this repo.
- Install TypeScript on your computer

```$ npm install -g typescript```

## Submission
Upon completion, run the following commands:
```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```
Navigate to your repo and create a pull request from your master branch to the original repository master branch.

In the pull request name, add your ProGrad Id and last names separated by a dash "-"

## How to run the project
- To compile the project
- Open the terminal inside Vscode editor and execute the following command.
    - ``` tsc main.ts ```
- Once you complie your typescript code, main.js file get generated automatically.
- Now run the main.js file to see the output. To run the file, use the command given below
    - ``` node main.js ```
- You can see the output in the terminal.
- Also open the index.html and see the output in browser console.

## Introduction
When we are studying, it's very common to strings and numbers so we remember to do specific exercises and tasks. Some of them are more important than others, but we have to remember all of them.

We are going to help you with this. How? We are going to work with strings and numbers in TypeScript. We are going to create different lists following different strategies with TypeScript. In the process, we will cover several important basic topics: variable types, functions, classes, and interfaces.

Project Structure
The project structure will be as follows:
```
starter-code/
├── progression-1
    ├── index.html
    ├── main.js
    └── main.ts

```
You are going to work over the *.ts files in the different folders, one for each progression that we are going to cover.

Note: Remember that the *.js files are generated every time we save the TypeScript files in our solution.

## Progression #1: Strings
In the first iteration of the exercise, we are going to work with Strings. Let's consider what we need to implement all the necessary string functions.

Once you have implemeneted all these features, you will have the first iteration completetd.

Tasks

- Go to main-service.ts.
Create an addTask function:
It receives a string as a parameter called task.
It adds the task to the array.
It prints a message indicating the insertion.
It returns the number of elements in the list and prints that number in the console as well.
Create a listAllTasks function:
It iterates over all the tasks in the list.
It prints each list item in the console.
Create a deleteTask function:
It receives a string as a parameter called task.
It removes that string from the array.
It returns the number of elements in the list after the deletion.
It prints a message indicating the deletion.
It returns the number of elements in the list and prints that number in the console as well.
Iteration #2: Class with one Interface

## Progression #2: Numbers

Happy Coding ProGrad ❤️
