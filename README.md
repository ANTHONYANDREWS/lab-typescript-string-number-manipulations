# lab-typescript-string-number-manipulations

## Learning Goals

After this lesson, you will be able to:

- Develop some basic TypeScript functions.
- Create a TypeScript interface, and use it from a class.
- Implement two different interfaces and use them from classes.

## Requirements
Fork this repo.
Clone this repo into your ~/code/labs folder.
Install TypeScript on your computer
```$ npm install -g typescript```

## Submission
Upon completion, run the following commands:
```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```
Navigate to your repo and create a pull request from your master branch to the original repository master branch.

In the pull request name, add your ProGrad Id and last names separated by a dash "-"

## Introduction
When we are studying, it's very common to strings and numbers so we remember to do specific exercises and tasks. Some of them are more important than others, but we have to remember all of them.

We are going to help you with this. How? We are going to work with strings and numbers in TypeScript. We are going to create different lists following different strategies with TypeScript. In the process, we will cover several important basic topics: variable types, functions, classes, and interfaces.

Project Structure
The project structure will be as follows:
```
starter-code/
├── progression-1
    ├── index.html
    ├── main.js
    └── main.ts

```
You are going to work over the *.ts files in the different folders, one for each progression that we are going to cover.

Note: Remember that the *.js files are generated every time we save the TypeScript files in our solution.

## Progression #1: Strings
In the first iteration of the exercise, we are going to work with Strings. Let's consider what we need to implement all the necessary string functions.

Once you have implemeneted all these features, you will have the first iteration completetd.

Tasks

- Create an .
Create an addTask function:
It receives a string as a parameter called task.
It adds the task to the array.
It prints a message indicating the insertion.
It returns the number of elements in the list and prints that number in the console as well.
Create a listAllTasks function:
It iterates over all the tasks in the list.
It prints each list item in the console.
Create a deleteTask function:
It receives a string as a parameter called task.
It removes that string from the array.
It returns the number of elements in the list after the deletion.
It prints a message indicating the deletion.
It returns the number of elements in the list and prints that number in the console as well.
Iteration #2: Class with one Interface

Happy coding!
